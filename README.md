**Overview of the Project**
Project - HR Analytics Dashboard
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive, interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to help HR professionals and management teams gain valuable insights into employee attrition trends, performance metrics, and workforce demographics. By analyzing these key factors, organizations can make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention, optimize HR policies, and enhance overall workforce performance.

Key Activities:
1. Data Collection & Import:

Import HR data from various sources such as Excel files or a SQL database. This data includes employee details, performance ratings, attrition status, salary, job satisfaction, department, etc.
Data preparation and cleaning to ensure it is ready for analysis (e.g., handling missing data, standardizing date formats).

2. Data Transformation & Modeling:

Transforming raw data into actionable insights by creating calculated columns, measures, and aggregations (e.g., calculating attrition rate, average salary, years of experience).
Build relationships between various datasets (e.g., linking employee demographics to attrition data).

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Define and calculate critical KPIs such as:
1) Employee Count: Total number of employees across various departments.
2) Attrition Rate: Percentage of employees who leave the organization.
3) Average Age: Mean age of employees in the organization.
4) Average Salary: Mean salary of employees across departments or other segments.
5) Average Years of Work Experience: Mean experience level of the workforce.
6) Job Satisfaction Rating: Average satisfaction score from employee feedback surveys.
   
Technologies Used:

1. Power BI:
Power BI Desktop: For data importing, transformation, and creating reports and dashboards.
Power BI Service: For sharing, collaboration, and distributing the final dashboard.

2. Data Sources:
Excel: For importing HR data like employee records, performance scores, etc.
SQL Server / Databases: For real-time HR data integration if applicable.

3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
Used for creating calculated fields, aggregations, and custom metrics (such as attrition rate, average salary, and years of experience).

4. Power Query:
For data cleaning, transformation, and shaping before loading into Power BI.

5. Visualization Tools in Power BI:
Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Line Graphs, and Scatter Plots: To visualize employee demographics, salary distribution, and attrition trends.
Heatmaps and Tree Maps: To analyze department-wise attrition and performance data.
Slicers and Filters: For user interactivity and data segmentation.
